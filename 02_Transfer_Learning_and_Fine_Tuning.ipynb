        "Transfer learning is a machine learning ***technique*** that **reuses a pre-trained model on a new problem** that is different but related to the original one. It allows the machine to exploit the knowledge gained from a previous task to improve generalization or speed up the training process for the new task.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transfer learning can be applied to any model, but it is especially useful for transformers, which are very complex and require a lot of data and computational power to train from scratch. By using a pre-trained transformer model on a large and diverse dataset, such as ImageNet or Wikipedia, we can leverage the features and patterns that the model has already learned and adapt them to a new task that may have less data or resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, we can use a pre-trained transformer model for natural language processing to fine-tune it for sentiment analysis, text summarization, or question answering. This way, we can achieve better performance and efficiency than training a new model from scratch.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Medical Image Computing**: CNNs can be used to analyze and diagnose medical images, such as X-rays, MRI scans, or CT scans. For example, CNNs can be used to `detect tumors, fractures, or diseases in various organs`.\n",
        "\n",

        "# Transfer Learning vs Fine-Tuning\n",
        "\n",
        "Transfer learning and fine-tuning are two related but distinct techniques in machine learning. They both involve **reusing a pre-trained model** on a new task/dataset, but they differ in how they update the model parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Transfer learning** is when a model developed for one task is reused to work on a second task that is different but related to the original one. It often involves using the same objective function and may freeze certain layers to retain general features.\n",
        "* For example, we can use a pre-trained model for image classification to extract features from images and use them as inputs for another model that performs a different task, such as face recognition or medical image analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Fine-tuning** is a step further than transfer learning, where you specialize the model to a particular task by changing the model output to fit the new task and train only the output layer or a few layers on top of the pre-trained model. It involves further training the pre-trained model on the new task by updating its weights with a smaller learning rate and often using a different training objective.\n",
        "\n",
        "* For example, we can use a pre-trained model for natural language processing to fine-tune it for a specific task, such as text classification, question answering, or text generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **main difference** between transfer learning and fine-tuning is that transfer learning freezes the pre-trained model and only trains the new layers, while fine-tuning unfreezes the pre-trained model and trains it along with the new layers. Transfer learning is usually faster and less prone to overfitting, while fine-tuning can achieve better performance and adaptability. The choice between transfer learning and fine-tuning depends on the similarity between the original task and the new task, the size and quality of the new dataset, and the computational resources available."
